Scratch some really bad lottery tickets

## Needed:

- UI to show a lottery ticket. Scratching it should reviel a pize
- Lottery ticket generator: Given a set of prizes, generate tickets with a X percentage of victory
- Dynamic URLs that shows a new lottery ticket
- Some sort of highscore / history tracking, so it is possible to go back to a winning ticket. Maybe enter your name to better track who's the winner?

## Start

`docker-compose up --build` will start on port 3000 with nodemon for hot reloading.

Then visit localhost:3000
